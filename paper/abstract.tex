  We introduce \emph{historical what-if queries}, a novel type of what-if analysis that determines the effect of a hypothetical change to the transactional history of a database. For example, \emph{``how would revenue be affected if we would have charged an additional \$6 for shipping?''} % 
  % 
\iftechreport{Such queries may lead to more actionable insights than traditional what-if queries as their results can be used to inform future actions, e.g., increasing shipping fees.}
%

%
%
We develop efficient techniques for answering historical what-if queries, i.e., determining how  a modified history affects the current database state. Our techniques are based on \emph{reenactment}, a % declarative
 replay technique for transactional histories.
%
% 
We optimize this process using
% 
 program and data slicing techniques that determine which updates and what data can be excluded from reenactment without affecting the result. Using an implementation of our techniques in \emph{Mahif} (a Middleware for Answering Historical what-IF queries) we demonstrate their effectiveness experimentally. %
