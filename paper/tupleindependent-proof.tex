  \begin{proof}
    WLOG consider a database $\db$ containing tuples $\{s_1, \ldots, s_m\}$ and let $\{t_1, \ldots, t_n\}$ be the instance of the relation $R$ to which a statement is applied to. Note that for any set comprehension $\{ e \mid e \in S \land \psi \}$ where $S = \{e_1, \ldots, e_n\}$ is a set and $\psi$ is a condition over $e$, the following equivalence holds if $\psi$ does not reference $S$:

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:factor-comprehensions}
      \{ e \mid e \in S \land \psi \} = \bigcup_{e \in S} \{ e \mid \psi \}
    \end{align}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    For deletes, updates, and insert of constant tuples ($\ainsert$), their result only depends on $\rel$ and no other relation in $\db$. Thus, they return $\emptyset$ for any single tuple instance $\{ s_i\}$ unless tuple $s_i$ belongs to $R$ and we trivially have for any statement $\up$ where $\up$ is either an update $\aupdate$, delete $\adelete$, or insert of a constant tuple $\ainsert$:

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:rel-update-same-as-database-update}
      \bigcup_{t \in R}  \up(\{t\}) = \bigcup_{t \in \db} \up(\{t\})
    \end{align}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \proofpar{Updates}:
    Consider an update $\aupdate$.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{align*}
      \aupdate(R) &= \{ \pset(t) \mid t \in R \wedge \cond(t) \} \cup \{ t \mid t \in R \wedge \neg \cond(t) \}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in R} \{ \pset(t) \mid \cond(t) \} \cup
                    \bigcup_{t \in R} \{ t \mid \neg \cond(t) \} \Cref{eq:factor-comprehensions}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in R} \{ \pset(t) \mid \cond(t) \} \cup \{ t \mid \neg \cond(t) \}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in R}  \aupdate(\{t\}) \tag{\Cref{eq:update-sem}}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in \db}  \aupdate(\{t\}) \tag{\Cref{eq:rel-update-same-as-database-update}}
    \end{align*}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \proofpar{Deletes}
    Consider a delete $\adelete$.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{align*}
      \adelete(R) &= \{ t \mid t \in R \wedge \neg \cond(t) \} \\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in R} \{ t \mid \cond(t) \} \tag{\Cref{eq:factor-comprehensions}}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in R}  \adelete(\{t\}) \tag{\Cref{eq:delete-sem}}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{t \in \db}  \adelete(\{t\}) \tag{\Cref{eq:rel-update-same-as-database-update}}

    \proofpar{Inserts}
    Consider an insert $\ainsert(R)$.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{align*}
      \ainsert(R) &= \rel \union \{ t\}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{s \in R} \{ s \} \union \{ t\}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{s \in R} (\{ s \} \union \{ t\})\\
                  &= \bigcup_{s \in R} \ainsert(\{s\}) \tag{\Cref{eq:const-insert-sem}}\\
                  &= \bigcup_{s \in \db}  \ainsert(\{s\}) \tag{\Cref{eq:rel-update-same-as-database-update}}
    \end{align*}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \proofpar{Inserts with queries}
    Inserts $\aqinsert(R)$ are not tuple independent. As a counterexample, consider $\up = \ins{\projection_{B,B}(R \join_{B=C} S)}(R)$ over $\rel(A,B)$ and $S(C)$ and database instance $R = \{(1,2)\}$ and $S = \{(2)\}$:
    \[
      \up(\db) = \{ (1,2), (2,2) \}
    \]
    while
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{align*}
      \bigcup_{t \in \db} \up(\{t\}) &= \up(R=\{(1,2)\},S=\emptyset) \cup \up(R=\emptyset,S=\{(2)\}) = \{(1,2)\} \cup \emptyset\\
                                       &= \{(1,2)\}
    \end{align*}
