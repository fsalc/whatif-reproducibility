\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We propose historical what-if queries, a new type of what-if queries which allow users to explore the effects of hypothetical changes to the transactional history of a database. Our system Mahif efficiently answers such queries using reenactment % --- a declarative replay technique for simulating updates. We also introduce
and  two novel optimization  techniques (program and data slicing) that exclude irrelevant data and updates from the computation.

% 
Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and of our optimizations.
%
In future work, we will explore how to augment a user's \abbrHW based on information about unobserved external factors and dependencies between updates, e.g., if a \abbrHW deletes the statement creating a customer from history, then the statements creating the orders of this customer should be removed too. Furthermore, we will explore novel application of our symbolic evaluation technique such as proving equivalence of histories.
